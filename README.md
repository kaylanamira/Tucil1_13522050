# Cyberpunk 2077 Breach Protocol
Cyberpunk 2077 Breach Protocol is a hacking minigame in the video game Cyberpunk 2077. This minigame simulates the hacking of local networks through ICE (Intrusion Countermeasures Electronics) within the Cyberpunk 2077 game. The components of this game include tokens, matrix, sequences, and buffers. The player navigates through matrix grid to match the required sequences. Player can only select tokens in a row or column, switching between the two with each selection, starting from the first row and column, until the buffer is full or sequences successfully match. This program aims to find the optimal solution of every combination of matrix, sequences, and buffersize by implementing brute force algorithm.
